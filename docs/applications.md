Applications
==============

Applications refer to both apps and watchfaces (as they are nearly identical from a technical POV).

Expected client behavior
------------------------

No authentication is needed to fetch applications using the endpoints described in this file.

The times are all full length [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO%208601) with timezone.

The platforms are `aplite` (Classic, Steel), `basalt` (Time, Time Steel), `chalk` (Time Round), `diorite` (Pebble 2). Note, however, that apps crawled from the Pebble App Store may have additional platform support (`emery` from the Pebble Time 2 and `ios` or `android`). You shouldn't care about these.

SQL Structure
-------------

See `rebbleHandlers/admin.go`

* `apps` contains information about specific apps;
* `authors` contains information about specific authors;
* `collections` contains a list of all applications belonging to said applications, because generating such a list on the fly from blob'd data from the `tag_ids` field in `apps` would be ridiculously expensive.
