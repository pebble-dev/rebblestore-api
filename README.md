## Rebble Store for pebble Backend/API
The Rebble Store is a Pebble Appstore replacement.
If you want to contribute join us on the [Pebble Dev Discord server](http://discord.gg/aRUAYFN), then head to `#appstore`.

## Requirements

Backend/API layer requires `git`, `go`, and `npm`

To make the backend do anything, you also need to download a copy of the Pebble App Store. You can already start downloading it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1rumprSXUAhTjB1aU9GUFVPUW8/view) while you setup the development environment.

## Dev Environment Setup
Pull down the project within your `$GOPATH`'s src folder ($GOPATH is an environment variable and is typically set to $HOME/go/ on \*nix). This can be done by running (for example) the following set of commands:

```shell
# export GOPATH=~/go/ # Optional if your didn't move your ~/go directory
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/pebble-dev
git clone https://github.com/pebble-dev/rebblestore-api.git $GOPATH/src/pebble-dev/rebblestore-api
```

### TLS

#### Disable TLS

If you want to disable TLS and serve unencrypted HTTP instead, set `HTTPS` to `false` in `rebblestore-api.json`

#### Create certificates

Then, you will need to generate a local (self signed) TLS certificate. The server only supports HTTPS, for obvious security reasons.
```shell
cd $GOPATH/src/pebble-dev/rebblestore-api

# Generating private key
openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp384r1 -out server.key

# Generating certificate
openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -key server.key -out server.crt -days 3650
```

When accessing the website for the first time, you will need to add a security exception (on Firefox) or to tell the browser to proceed anyways (on Chromium), as a self-signed certificate cannot be trusted by your browser.

## Build Process

### Backend
1. If you haven't already, you will need to run `go get -v .` within the project directory;
2. Run either `make` to build everything, or `go build -v .` to just build the go executable;
3. You can run the api with `./rebblestore-api`, or run the tests with `./rebblestore-api-tests`.

### Auth service

You need the Rebble Authentication service to be able to create and login to an account.

Head over to [rebble-auth](https://github.com/pebble-dev/rebble-auth) and follow the README instructions.

Make sure your `authUrl` key in `rebblestore-api.json` corresponds to the URL of the auth service. You should also run your auth service in plain HTTP if you don't have a signed SSL certificate (which will be the case in test environments), otherwise the backend will not be able to query it.

### Database

Instructions to setup the database:

1. If you haven't already, download a copy of the Pebble App Store by using [this tool](https://github.com/azertyfun/PebbleAppStoreCrawler). To ease the load on fitbit's servers, you can download it directly [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1rumprSXUAhTjB1aU9GUFVPUW8/view);
2. Extract the PebbleAppStore folder to the project directory: `tar -xzf PebbleAppStore.tar.gz -C $GOPATH/src/pebble-dev/rebblestore-api`, or if you have already extracted it somewhere, create a link to it using `ln -s /path/to/PebbleAppStore PebbleAppStore`;
3. Start `./rebblestore-api` and access https://localhost:8080/admin/rebuild/db to rebuild the database.

### Configuration

To prevent XSS, we set a CORS header. Set the `storeUrl` key in `rebblestore-api.json` to `http://localhost:8081`.

To allow user to authenticate themselves, you will need to get OAuth2 keys for your OpenID providers. Then, fill the `client_id` and `client_secret` fields in the `rebblestore-api.json` file.

## Contributing

### How Do I Help?

Everyone is welcome to help. Efforts are coordinated in the [issues tab](https://github.com/pebble-dev/rebblestore-api/issues), and in the [Discord Server](http://discord.gg/aRUAYFN) in the channel `#appstore`.

If this is your first time contributing to an Open-Source project, you can [read this article](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-collaborate-on-github--net-34267) to familiarize yourself with the process.

Please [format your code with go fmt](https://blog.golang.org/go-fmt-your-code) and run `go test` before committing your changes. Some editor plugins (such as vim-go) should be able to do this automatically before save.

You should start by checking the `docs/` folder!

### Code Structure

* The core of the backend is an HTTP server powered by [Go's http library](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/) as well as [the gorilla/mux URL router and dispatcher](https://github.com/gorilla/mux);
* URLs are routed in `rebbleHandlers/routes.go` (each URL gets its custom handler across multiple files);
* When a valid URL is accessed, the corresponding handler is called. For example, `{server}/admin/version` is served by `AdminVersionHandler` in `rebbleHandlers/admin.go`;
* `rebbleHandlers/admin.go` serves the database builder (used the first time you run the backend, or every time you add new columns to the DB that require data from the Pebble App Store archive);
* `rebbleHandlers/application.go` defines application structures (namely `RebbleApplication`), populates them, and handles most requests pertaining to the applications themselves;
* `rebbleHandlers/boot.go` handles the mobile application URI bootstrap, as [described on the wiki](https://github.com/pebble-dev/wiki/wiki/Mobile-Application-URI-Bootstrap).
