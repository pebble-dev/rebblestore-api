## Rebble Store for pebble Backend/API
The Rebble Store is a Pebble Appstore replacement.
If you want to contribute join us on the [Pebble Dev Discord server](http://discord.gg/aRUAYFN), then head to `#appstore`.

## Requirements

Backend/API layer requires `git`, `go`, `npm`, `postgresql` and `apib2swagger`.

To make the backend do anything, you also need to download a copy of the Pebble App Store. You can already start downloading it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1rumprSXUAhTjB1aU9GUFVPUW8/view) while you setup the development environment.

## Dev Environment Setup
Pull down the project within your `$GOPATH`'s src folder ($GOPATH is an environment variable and is typically set to $HOME/go/ on \*nix). This can be done by running (for example) the following set of commands:

```shell
# export GOPATH=~/go/ # Optional if your didn't move your ~/go directory
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/pebble-dev
git clone https://github.com/pebble-dev/rebblestore-api.git $GOPATH/src/pebble-dev/rebblestore-api
```

## Build Process

### Backend
1. If you haven't already, you will need to run `go get -v .` within the project directory;
2. Run either `make` to build everything, or `go build -v .` to just build the go executable;
3. You can run the api with `./rebblestore-api`, or run the tests with `./rebblestore-api-tests`.

### Database

Instructions to setup the database:

1. If you haven't already, download a copy of the Pebble App Store by using [this tool](https://github.com/azertyfun/PebbleAppStoreCrawler). To ease the load on fitbit's servers, you can download it directly [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1rumprSXUAhTjB1aU9GUFVPUW8/view);
2. Extract the PebbleAppStore folder to the project directory: `tar -xzf PebbleAppStore.tar.gz -C $GOPATH/src/pebble-dev/rebblestore-api`;
3. Setup the PostgreSQL database with a `rebblestore` user and a `rebblestore` database (as described on the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PostgreSQL)), then [enable SSL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ssl-tcp.html) in `postgresql.conf`;
4. Start `./rebblestore-api` and access http://localhost:8080/admin/rebuild/db to rebuild the database.

## Contributing

### How Do I Help?

Everyone is welcome to help. Efforts are coordinated in the [issues tab](https://github.com/pebble-dev/rebblestore-api/issues), and in the [Discord Server](http://discord.gg/aRUAYFN) in the channel `#appstore`.

If this is your first time contributing to an Open-Source project, you can [read this article](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-collaborate-on-github--net-34267) to familiarize yourself with the process.

Please [format your code with go fmt](https://blog.golang.org/go-fmt-your-code) and run `go test` before committing your changes. Some editor plugins (such as vim-go) should be able to do this automatically before save.


### Code Structure

* The core of the backend is an HTTP server powered by [Go's http library](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/) as well as [the gorilla/mux URL router and dispatcher](https://github.com/gorilla/mux);
* URLs are routed in `routes.go` (each URL gets its custom handler across multiple files);
* When a valid URL is accessed, the corresponding handler is called. For example, `{server}/admin/version` is served by `AdminVersionHandler` in `admin.go`;
* `admin.go` serves the database builder (used the first time you run the backend, or every time you add new columns to the DB that require data from the Pebble App Store archive);
* `application.go` defines application structures (namely `RebbleApplication`), populates them, and handles most requests pertaining to the applications themselves;
* `boot.go` handles the mobile application URI bootstrap, as [described on the wiki](https://github.com/pebble-dev/wiki/wiki/Mobile-Application-URI-Bootstrap).
